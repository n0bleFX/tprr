# TPRR Decision Log

Chronological record of methodology and scaffolding decisions. Every material
methodology choice must have an entry here.

## 2026-04-23 — Project initialised

**Decision**: Python 3.13 pinned via uv; uv for dependency management; dependency lower-bounds set per pyproject.toml.

**Context**: Matt's system has Python 3.14.4 available; we pin a specific version to reduce ecosystem-edge risk during MVP development.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Python 3.14 — currently cutting edge; some packages (e.g. Plotly classifiers) haven't been updated to declare 3.14 support even though they work; adds debugging friction.
- Python 3.12 — most conservative, widest compatibility; chose 3.13 as reasonable middle ground with modern type system support.
- Poetry / pip-tools / pipenv — uv is materially faster and has better Python-version management.

**Rationale**: 3.13 is feature-complete, has broad wheel coverage across all planned dependencies, and matches the target Python for production if this MVP graduates. uv's managed-Python model isolates the project from the system interpreter.

**Impact**: None on index values. All tooling (mypy, ruff) targets 3.13. Move to 3.14 can happen post-MVP once ecosystem settles.

## 2026-04-23 — Canonical methodology document imported

**Decision**: `docs/tprr_methodology.md` populated with TPRR methodology v1.2 as maintained by Matt.

**Context**: Methodology v1.2 is the canonical reference for this MVP's implementation. CLAUDE.md's methodology summary is a working subset; the canonical doc is authoritative where they conflict.

**Rationale**: Every implementation decision downstream references this document.

**Impact**: This file is the source of truth for Phase 7.0 pipeline confirmation and all scenario/sensitivity interpretation.

## 2026-04-23 — TWAP ordering resolved to TWAP-then-weight

**Decision**: Daily fix computes each constituent's daily TWAP from 96 fifteen-minute slot observations first, then applies the dual-weighted cross-constituent aggregation once using those daily TWAPs as inputs.

**Context**: Section 4.2.1 specifies TPRR Daily Fix = TWAP(Pᵢ(t)) over 96 intervals between 09:00–17:00 UTC; Section 3.3.1 specifies the dual-weighted instantaneous formula. The composition order is not explicit — TWAP(Pᵢ(t)) admits two readings: (i) TWAP each constituent's price first, then weight (TWAP-then-weight), or (ii) compute the weighted index at each slot, then TWAP the 96 slot-level indices (weight-then-TWAP).

**Alternatives considered**:
- TWAP-then-weight (chosen) — matches dominant commodity-benchmark convention (ICE Brent, Henry Hub, ASCI); tier median and exponential weight operate on one comparable daily price per constituent; dimensionally consistent.
- Weight-then-TWAP — closer to a strict reading of "apply formula at each t then TWAP over t"; more computationally expensive; may behave differently on days when slot-level quality gate fires or constituent membership changes intraday.

**Rationale**: Commodity-benchmark precedent, computational tractability, dimensional consistency of the median operating on comparable daily prices.

**Impact**: Phase 10 includes `scripts/twap_ordering_comparison.py` running the full backtest under both orderings and producing `docs/findings/twap_ordering.md`. If empirical divergence is material, methodology v1.3 should resolve the ambiguity explicitly in Section 4.2.1.

**Methodology section**: 3.3.1, 4.2.1

## 2026-04-23 — Section 4.2.3 (transaction cross-validation) deferred from MVP

**Decision**: The MVP does not implement Section 4.2.3 Independent Transaction Cross-Validation.

**Context**: Section 4.2.3 specifies independent API probing to sample actual transaction prices for cross-validation against contributor-submitted prices, with >2% deviation triggering investigation. This requires live production infrastructure, enterprise API access across all tracked providers, and operational capacity to investigate flagged discrepancies.

**Rationale**: Deferred to post-MVP production build per the "production only" carve-out in CLAUDE.md non-goals. The MVP validates the five manipulation controls that can be exercised against synthetic and observable reference data: 4.2.1 TWAP aggregation, 4.2.2 slot-level quality gate, 4.2.4 minimum-constituent requirement, 4.2.5 prohibition on provider self-reported volumes, 4.2.6 continuous exponential weighting.

**Impact**: Phase 10 scenario and sensitivity coverage is five-of-six controls. Transaction cross-validation enters scope when Noble has enterprise API relationships in place and a dedicated investigation workflow.

**Methodology section**: 4.2.3
