# TPRR Decision Log

Chronological record of methodology and scaffolding decisions. Every material
methodology choice must have an entry here.

## 2026-04-23 — Project initialised

**Decision**: Python 3.13 pinned via uv; uv for dependency management; dependency lower-bounds set per pyproject.toml.

**Context**: Matt's system has Python 3.14.4 available; we pin a specific version to reduce ecosystem-edge risk during MVP development.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Python 3.14 — currently cutting edge; some packages (e.g. Plotly classifiers) haven't been updated to declare 3.14 support even though they work; adds debugging friction.
- Python 3.12 — most conservative, widest compatibility; chose 3.13 as reasonable middle ground with modern type system support.
- Poetry / pip-tools / pipenv — uv is materially faster and has better Python-version management.

**Rationale**: 3.13 is feature-complete, has broad wheel coverage across all planned dependencies, and matches the target Python for production if this MVP graduates. uv's managed-Python model isolates the project from the system interpreter.

**Impact**: None on index values. All tooling (mypy, ruff) targets 3.13. Move to 3.14 can happen post-MVP once ecosystem settles.

## 2026-04-23 — Canonical methodology document imported

**Decision**: `docs/tprr_methodology.md` populated with TPRR methodology v1.2 as maintained by Matt.

**Context**: Methodology v1.2 is the canonical reference for this MVP's implementation. CLAUDE.md's methodology summary is a working subset; the canonical doc is authoritative where they conflict.

**Rationale**: Every implementation decision downstream references this document.

**Impact**: This file is the source of truth for Phase 7.0 pipeline confirmation and all scenario/sensitivity interpretation.
